   Monte Carlo simulations are named after the gambling hot spot in Monaco.

   There are two components to an asset's price movements: 
         drift, which is a constant directional movement, 
         random input, which represents market volatility. 
   By analyzing historical price data, you can determine the drift, standard deviation, variance, and average price movement for a security. 

   Volatility can be measured using two different methods. 
   First is based on performing statistical calculations on the historical prices over a specific time period. 
   This process involves computing various statistical numbers, like mean (average), variance and finally the standard deviation on the historical price data sets.

   More volatile assets are considered riskier than less volatile assets because the price is expected to be less predictable

   Variance is a measurement of the spread between numbers in a data set.
   The variance measures how far each number in the set is from the mean.
   The square root of variance is the standard deviation.
   Standard deviation measures the dispersion of a dataset relative to its mean.

   A volatile stock has a high standard deviation, while the deviation of a stable blue-chip stock is usually rather low.
   If the data points are further from the mean, there is a higher deviation within the data set; thus, the more spread out the data, the higher the standard deviation.
   As a downside, it calculates all uncertainty as risk, even when it’s in the investor's favor—such as above average returns.
